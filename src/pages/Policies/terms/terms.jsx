                In no event shall the Company, or any of its officers, directors

                any way connected with a User’s use of this Website and/or

                damage, cost or expense that the Company may suffer or incur as

                The user’s access and/or use of the Website and/or Services, any
                downloaded material from it and the operation of these Terms
                (including any transaction concluded pursuant thereto) shall be
                governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
                Republic of South Africa only. Should any dispute, disagreement
                or claim (“dispute”) arise between the parties concerning the
                provision of the Services or Website, the parties shall
                endeavour to resolve the dispute amicably, by negotiation, and
                with the best interests of both parties in mind. Should the
                parties fail to resolve such dispute in the aforesaid manner or
                within such further period as the parties may agree to in their
                negotiation, then they shall use the services and assistance of
                any applicable regulator and/or ombud, or finally, by
                confidential arbitration in terms of the expedited rules of the
                Arbitration Foundation of South Africa (“AFSA”), with an
                arbitrator selected by Zaio. Arbitration proceedings shall be
                conducted in Cape Town, in English. Notwithstanding the above,
                both parties consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the
                Magistrate’s Court of the Republic of South Africa, even in the
                event where the quantum in the dispute may be less than the
                monetary jurisdiction of that court. Both parties shall bear the
                costs for any applicable dispute resolutions processes equally,
                unless determined otherwise by an authorised arbitrator/judge
                who may make an award with regard to costs. The parties both
                agree that in no circumstance will either party publicize the
                dispute on any social media or other public platform. The
                parties understand that any publicity of this nature can cause
                serious damage to the other party, which damage may result in a
                financial claim. Notwithstanding the above, both parties retain
                all of their concurrent rights as provided for under applicable
                legislation.
